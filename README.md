# GeohashApp

This project is just a simple tool to visualise what'd discussed here: https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/geolocation-query-in-firestore-realtime/

The main calculations were taken from the Geofire's [utils](https://github.com/firebase/geofire-js/blob/master/src/utils.ts) and geohash encoding/decoding was taken from [latlon-geohash](https://github.com/chrisveness/latlon-geohash/blob/master/latlon-geohash.js)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
